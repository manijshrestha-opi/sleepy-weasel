OPI hackathon team repo

# Cabin/Condo Reservation system

The cabin and condo have the same requirements.  

- There are 2 seasons
  - Winter (November -- April)
  - Summer (May -- October)
- There are 2 reservation “types” 
  - Mass Registration - more details to follow
  - Remaining time slots
- Reservations are keeping the same week/weekend structure
  - Week is anytime Monday - Noon Friday
  - Weekend is 3:00 pm Friday - end of day Sunday
- Chris picks his dates before anyone else and has first priority.
- Open to employees only
- Changes to the condo schedule will be sent out to a third party (via email).
- The shared google calendar will reflect an up-to date representation of who is currently assigned to a given time-slot


## Mass Registration:
- Only allowed to be assigned to one slot at either the Cabin or Condo
- OPI Seniority is considered in reservation “priority”
  - Doesn’t have to mean pick first
  - Could be lottery style with more “chances” for seniority
  - Open to each team to solve as they think best
- Open for a limited time window

## Remaining time slots:
- Based on availability
- Open to any OPI’er regardless of current reservations
- Can fall outside a normal Week or weekend if days before or after are not filled
asdfasdf (most important requirement)

## Nice to have:
- Authentication against OPI Google Account
- Update users calendar when reservation is accepted/created
